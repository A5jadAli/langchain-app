# langchain-app
This is a streamlit webapp with the integration of LangChain. It can be used to query with document files like .pdf, .docx and .zip files. To run this file locally on your PC/Laptop you have to downnload both langchain_app.py and requirements.txt file.
After downloading both files have have to make sure both of them are in same folder and and you are also in that folder then run this command in the command prompt: pip install -r requirements.txt
After that all the requirements will be installed on your laptop and you can run this command again in the command prompt to use this app:
streamlit run langchain_app.py

That's all after few seconds appp will open in your browser. If you face any issue you can paste in the discussion section, I will always be there to help you.
